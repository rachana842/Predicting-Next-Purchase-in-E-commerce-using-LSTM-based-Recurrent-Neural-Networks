# Predicting-Next-Purchase-in-E-commerce-using-LSTM-based-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
Abstract: Predicting the next purchase in e-commerce platforms plays a pivotal role in enhancing user experience and increasing sales. In this research, we propose a novel approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to address this challenge. Our objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the next purchase based on a user's historical purchase sequence.
We begin by preprocessing the dataset, which involves splitting purchase sequences into lists, encoding each purchase category, and padding sequences to ensure uniform length. Subsequently, we construct an LSTM-based neural network architecture comprising an embedding layer, LSTM layer, and time-distributed dense layer. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and its performance is evaluated on test data.
Our key findings indicate that the LSTM-based model achieves a test accuracy of 0.70, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting next purchases. Additionally, we provide recommendations for the top purchases based on the input sequence, enabling personalized suggestions for users.
The implications of this research are significant for e-commerce businesses, as accurate next purchase predictions can lead to improved customer satisfaction and increased revenue. Our approach offers a valuable contribution to the field of recommendation systems, showcasing the potential of LSTM-based RNNs in e-commerce settings.
